# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System

This project presents a deep learning–based Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system using a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark
(GTSRB) dataset.

The project uses the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, a well-
established benchmark for traffic sign classification tasks.

Dataset Summary

● Total images: ~50,000

● Number of classes: 43

● Image type: RGB

● Image dimensions: 15×15 to 250×250 (varied)

● Task: Multi-class classification


The final model achieved:

Overall Test Accuracy: 96.86%

This demonstrates strong performance on unseen images.
